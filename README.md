# Sporty Group Assignment

A modern Angular application for browsing sports leagues with interactive features, built using best practices and AI-assisted development.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Angular application consumes the [TheSportsDB API](https://www.thesportsdb.com/api/v1/json/3/all_leagues.php) to display sports leagues with advanced filtering, search, and modal interactions. The app demonstrates modern Angular patterns including signals, OnPush change detection, and comprehensive TypeScript usage.
